<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asi-im-bir/TerraformSecureInfraLab/main/terraform.png" alt="Terraform Secure Infrastructure Architecture" width="750"/>
</p>

The **Terraform Secure Infrastructure Lab** builds a **defense-in-depth Azure environment** that separates public and private workloads, manages secrets securely, and enforces least-privilege access.

---

### üåê Overview

All resources are deployed inside an **Azure Virtual Network (VNet)** divided into two subnets:

- **Public Subnet (DMZ):** Hosts the **Bastion VM**, the only resource with a public IP.  
  SSH access is restricted to a specific admin IP.

- **Private Subnet (App):** Hosts the **Private VM**, which has **no public IP** and connects only through the Bastion VM.

- **Azure Key Vault:** Stores all secrets (e.g., SSH keys, credentials) and is accessed securely via **Managed Identities**, eliminating plaintext secrets.

- **Azure Active Directory (AAD):** Provides authentication and **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** for users and services.

- **Azure Monitor & Log Analytics:** Collect logs and metrics from all components for visibility, alerting, and compliance.

---

### üîê Security Layers

| Layer | Implementation |
|--------|----------------|
| **Network Isolation** | Public and private subnets protected with NSGs and minimal open ports. |
| **Identity Security** | Managed Identities and RBAC ensure least-privilege access. |
| **Secret Management** | Centralized secrets in Key Vault with soft delete and access logging. |
| **Operational Monitoring** | Azure Monitor tracks performance, security, and access events. |

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Flow Summary

1. Admin connects to **Bastion VM** from an approved IP via SSH.  
2. **Bastion VM** connects to **Private VM** over the internal network.  
3. **Private VM** retrieves secrets from **Azure Key Vault** using its Managed Identity.  
4. **Azure AD** authenticates all access requests and enforces RBAC.  

This architecture ensures a **secure, auditable, and cost-optimized Azure environment**, following best practices from the **Azure Well-Architected Framework**.

### üîí Security Flow Summary

| Component | Role | Key Security Controls |
|------------|------|------------------------|
| **Bastion VM** | Secure entry point | Public IP restricted to admin source IP; SSH only. |
| **Private VM** | Application workload | No public IP; accesses Key Vault via Managed Identity. |
